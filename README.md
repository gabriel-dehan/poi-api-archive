# POI API Archive

Archive of an old startup project in Ruby On Rails. Main documentation is, sadly, private on Notion because a lot of information can't be released publicly.

This application was the main API, with most of the business logic and cashback calculation algorithms, as well as an event receiving endpoint for our "observer" app.
API was consumed by a React Native application.
API Documentation used slate and was hand-written and maintained.


Most interesting bits reside in the models, controllers/concerns as well as app/services, app/lib and lib/middlewares
